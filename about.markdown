I am a statistician based in NYC. My areas of work center around spatial statistics, economics and bayesian inference.

I currently work as a Manager of Data Science at [The Rockefeller Foundation](https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org) (a philanthropic organization) where I advise and provide technical analysis to our initiatives and grant-making projects. Before Rockefeller I worked as a Data Scientist at BuzzFeed where I focused on adtech, modeling reserve prices and ad auctions. Formerly, I was a Statistical Geneticist at Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research in Long Island where [I developed models to study endometriosis](https://molmed.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s10020-018-0009-6).

I have a Graduate Diploma in Statistics and Stochastic Processes by the University of Melbourne (Australia) and BA by the University of Guadalajara (Mexico).
