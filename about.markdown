I am a statistician based in NYC. I currently work as a Manager and Data Scientist at [The Rockefeller Foundation](https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org) (a philanthropic organization) where I advise and provide technical analysis to our initiatives and grant-making projects.

Before Rockefeller I worked as a Data Scientist at BuzzFeed where I focused on understanding and modeling programmatic advertisement. Formerly, I was a Statistical Geneticist at Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research in Long Island where [I developed models to study endometriosis](https://molmed.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s10020-018-0009-6).

Currently, I am a board member of the [Stan Governing Body](https://mc-stan.org/about/).

I have a Graduate Diploma in Statistics and Stochastic Processes by the University of Melbourne (Australia) and BA by the University of Guadalajara (Mexico).
